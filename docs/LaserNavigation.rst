Laser Ablation System - Sample Navigation & Georectification
*****

Introduction
=====
This document serves as a guide to georectification and low-zoom optical sample navigation on the Thermo-Fisher Scientific Element2 Laser Ablation system in the PLASMA lab at California State University, Northridge.

Georectification
=====
This section will guide you through georectification of an existing image (optical, CL, etc) in the Chromium2.3 Laser Ablation software.

.. Note:: In order to successfully georectify an optical image on the laser, it is imperative that it does not already contain any significant dimensional distortion from a stitching process. For this reason, images from the SEM or Nikon petrographic microscope are ideal.

.. Note:: More coming soon!
