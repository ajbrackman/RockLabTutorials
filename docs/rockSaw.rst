Set-Up
*******

#. Check that the tray has adequate **clean** water in it to cover the water pump.

#. Ensure that the black tray and blade slot are clear of debris.

#. Plug the water pump into the outlet on the left side of the saw.

#. Flip the switch on the saw motor to start the blade.

#. Check that water is running and being distributed evenly on both sides of the spinning saw blade.

Sample Cutting
***************

#. Inspect your sample to establish a proper orientation for cutting. The optimal cutting orientation will be influenced by several factors: lineation and foliation, sample size, and sample shape. You will need to find the best position to stabilize the rock while also keeping yourself out of the way.

#. *Gently* advance the black tray (and your sample) towards the saw. It is very important NOT to force your sample into the saw. Rock saws work by slowly grinding through the rock, excess force will bind up the blade and even possibly blow the fuse.

.. Attention:: If you push a sample too hard and blow the fuse, PPM must be called to reset it.

#. Maintain gentle pressure on your sample and the tray until the cut is complete.

#. Repeat until done.

Clean-Up
*********
